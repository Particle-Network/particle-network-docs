# Use AA

This guide will help you get started with Particle Connect and Particle AA Android SDK by setting up your environment, creating a wallet with a social account, and sending a User Operation from it. By the end of this guide, you'll have a basic understanding of how to use the SDK and where to look for more advanced use cases.

If you face any problems at any time, you can always refer to the Particle Community for us to help you out as soon as possible!
