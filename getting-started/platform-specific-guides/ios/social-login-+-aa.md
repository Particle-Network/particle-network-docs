# Social Login + AA

This guild will help you get started with Particle Auth and Particle AA iOS SDK by setting up your environment, creating a wallet with social account, and sending a User Opeartion from it. By the end of this guide, you'll have a basic understanding of how to use the SDK and where to look for more advanced user cases.

If you face any problem anytime, you can always refer to the Particle[ ](https://github.com/Web3Auth/Web3Auth/discussions)Community for us to help you out as soon as possible!
