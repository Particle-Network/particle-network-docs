1. Use [Particle Auth](../developers/auth-service/) to onboard users using Email, Phone, and Social Accounts in their familiar way, enabling a seamless seedless experience by Particle's MPC-TSS technology;
2. Use [Particle Connect](../developers/connect-service/) to onboard web3 wallet users more easily;
3. Use [Particle AA Stack](../developers/account-abstraction/) to enable Account Abstraction, to get the gasless feature, batch transactions, session keys, etc;
4. Use [Particle Embedded Wallet](../developers/wallet-service/) to add a fully functional EOA/Smart Wallet into your dApp in one line of code.
