1. Use [Particle Auth](../developers/auth-service/) to onboard users using Email, Phone, and Social Accounts in their familiar way, enabling a seemless seedless experience by Particle's MPC-TSS technology;
2. &#x20;User [Particle Connect](../developers/connect-service/) to onboard web3 wallet users more easily;
3. User [Particle AA Stack](../developers/account-abstraction/) to enable Account Abstraction, to get the gasless feature, batch transactions, session keys, etc.
