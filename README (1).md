# üí° What is Particle?

**Particle Network** is the Intent-Centric, Modular Access Layer of Web3: Built with Particle Network's Modular Smart Wallet-as-a-Service, Confidential zkStack, Omnichain Account Abstraction & Intent Fusion Protocol). Our vision is to accelerate the world's transition into the cryptoverse. Using our powerful SDKs, developers can focus on creating great app experiences rather than the heavy lifting.

## Products

#### Auth Service

**Particle Auth** provides MPC (Multi-Party Computation)-based threshold signatures.

With threshold signatures, each party creates an independent key. They then forge the vault‚Äôs lock together in a modular way, in which each party shapes a part of the lock that corresponds to its key.

Our security is unlike any other auth/wallet service: it's better. Complex passwords and long seed phrases, browser extensions, and special hardware are no longer required for log-in. Instead, accounts are secured by industry-leading TSS implementation and KMS encryption.

With Particle Auth integrated into your dApp, users can log in within seconds. By removing seed phrases, we can increase conversion rates by up to 64% for both new and Web3.0 users.
