# On-Ramp

Particle has integrated multiple On-Ramp channels, supporting hundreds of fiat and various chains and cryptocurrencies.&#x20;

This lets our partners purchase cryptocurrency directly through various local and global fiat payment methods. This may be particularly useful for novice users who do not yet have any cryptocurrency holdings. By allowing users to purchase cryptocurrency directly with fiat currency, exchanges, DeFi protocols, wallets, and Web3 services can more easily onboard new users into the crypto market and begin investing in digital assets.
