## Custom Auth

With Particle Auth, you can seamlessly integrate your existing user base or authentication method. This allows your users to continue logging in with their existing accounts. Additionally, you can also use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) . Visit [https://jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to learn more about JWT. Set your custom JWT configuration on the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/).
