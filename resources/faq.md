# FAQ

## What networks do you support?

[ðŸ‘‰ Check out our supported networks here](https://docs.particle.network/#available-networks)

## How do I integrate my own user ID system?

After the user successfully logs in, **Particle Auth** SDK will return the user **UUID** and **token**. You can then retrieve and verify the user info by calling [a server API](../auth-service/sdks/server-api.md).

## What types of NFTs are supported?

**Particle Wallet** supports images and 3D models. For media types not supported, the default cover image will be displayed. Audio files and video files will be supported soon.
