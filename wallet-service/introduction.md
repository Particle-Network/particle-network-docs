# Introduction

## What is Particle Walletï¼Ÿ

**The Particle Wallet** **is not an independent walletâ€”it is a wallet infrastructure plugged into apps or wallets.**

With Particle Wallet, you can integrate a wallet tailored to your app's needs, with features including transaction functions, NFT displays, and more.

## Using Particle Wallet to Build Your Wallet <a href="#using-web3auth-to-build-your-wallet" id="using-web3auth-to-build-your-wallet"></a>

Using Particle Wallet, you have the flexibility to choose between building an app with an in-app wallet, or a standalone wallet itself. This has its advantages:

* **Ownership**: the dApp/wallet owns the whole experience, with minimal external branding. You'll even be able to use your own OAuth or single sign-on (SSO).
* **Easy to understand**: first-time users don't need the mental overhead of understanding the concept of a "wallet" to use your app.
* **In-app experience**: users can manage their wallets and make transactions within your app, creating a seamless experience specific to your app.

## What Are Particle **Wallet**'s features?

* **Rapid development**: we provide a complete wallet SDK with functions including transaction abilities, NFT displays and trading, signatures, etc. This reduces development time for you and ensures security for users.
* **A complete UI interface**: Particle Wallet provides a variety of highly adaptable UI interfaces for different app styles and scenarios.
* **Supports the use of independent functions**: to ensure the continuity of user experience, we support the utilization of a single function in a specific scenario. For example: to transfer funds, the user can call on a "transfer" page rather than having to enter the wallet.
