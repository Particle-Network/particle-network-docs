# Introduction

## What is Particle Authï¼Ÿ

Particle Auth is a simple self-custodial auth infra for Web3 apps and wallets. We support mobile number and email login, providing users with a simple operating experience. Their login account is then associated with a blockchain wallet, which is secured with a "Threshold Signatures vault".

## What does Particle Auth do? <a href="#what-does-web3auth-do" id="what-does-web3auth-do"></a>

By integrating Particle Auth into your project, your users can experience the following services:

* **Email/Mobile number logins and passwordless flows**: users can register with a mobile phone number or email address, then log in using a verification code. This shortens the login process while maintaining a secure login.Now, we also provide mainstream social media logins for Web3 developers.
* **Provide MPC (Multi-Party Computation)-based threshold signatures:** With threshold signatures, each of the parties creates a key independently. Then, they forge the vaultâ€™s lock together, in a modular way, in which each party shapes a part of the lock that corresponds to its key.

## What Are Particle Auth's features?

* **Speedy logins**: the log-in process is no different from that of a Web2.0 login, which greatly lowers the barriers to entry and improves user experience.
* **Non-custodial private key infrastructure**: Particle Network provides MPC (Multi-Party Computation)-based TSS (Threshold Signatures Scheme). With TSS, each party creates an independent key. They then forge the vault's lock together in a modular way, in which each party shapes a part of the lock that corresponds to its key. The user is always in control of ownership and access to their cryptographic key pair.
* **Whitelabel:** customize Particle Auth's UI so that it blends directly into your application, you can brand in the Dashboard.
* **Signature**: a full signature service.
