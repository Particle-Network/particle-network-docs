# Introduction

## What is Particle Authï¼Ÿ

Particle Auth is a simple self-custodial auth infra for Web3 apps and wallets. We support mobile number and email login, providing users with a simple operating experience. Their login account is then associated with a blockchain wallet, which is secured with a "Threshold Signatures vault".

## Why Particle Auth?&#x20;

Particle Auth is committed to helping Web2 users enter the Web3 world easily with their most familiar login methods.&#x20;

Users can login to your dApp through **Google, Apple ID, Facebook, Twitter and other social methods**, and can also login with **Email / Mobile number** without password.&#x20;

After the user successfully logs in, Particle Auth will automatically create a crypto wallet without a private key. The security is guaranteed by **MPC (Multi Party Computing) - based threshold signatures**, which is ahead of other technologies.

## What Are Particle Auth's features?

* **Speedy logins**: the log-in process is no different from that of a Web2.0 login, which greatly lowers the barriers to entry and improves user experience.
* **Non-custodial private key infrastructure**: Particle Network provides MPC (Multi-Party Computation)-based TSS (Threshold Signatures Scheme). With TSS, each party creates an independent key. They then forge the vault's lock together in a modular way, in which each party shapes a part of the lock that corresponds to its key. The user is always in control of ownership and access to their cryptographic key pair.
* **Custom UI:** customize Particle Auth's UI so that it blends directly into your application, you can brand in the Dashboard.
* **Signature Service**: a full signature service, including Send Transaction, Sign Message and so on. Your users can view the detailed data of each signature.
